## Architechture

[![arch](media/arch.png)]()

The infrastructure is defined using Terraform and is composed of several modules to manage different components of the AWS environment. Below is an overview of the architecture:

- VPC:
  - The VPC module creates a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with a specified CIDR block and a private subnet.
  - VPC CIDR Block: 10.0.0.0/16
  - Private Subnet CIDR Block: 10.0.1.0/24

- Security Groups
  - The Security Groups module creates security groups for the application instances and the Application Load Balancer (ALB).
  - Instance Security Group: Allows inbound traffic on port 80 from the ALB security group.
  - ALB Security Group: Allows inbound traffic on port 443 from any IP.

- Application Load Balancer (ALB)
  - The ALB module sets up an Application Load Balancer to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances.
  - ALB Name: s3-alb
  - Target Group Name: s3-tg
  - Domain Name: getmesmer.xyz

- Auto Scaling
  - The Auto Scaling module configures an Auto Scaling Group to manage the number of EC2 instances based on the load.
  - AMI ID: ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0 (Amazon Linux 2)
  - Instance Type: t3a.small
  - Desired Capacity: 2
  - Max Size: 4
  - Min Size: 1

- ACM (AWS Certificate Manager)
  - The ACM module manages SSL/TLS certificates for the domain.
  - Domain Name: getmesmer.xyz

- Outputs
  - ALB DNS Name: The DNS name of the Application Load Balancer.
  - Certificate ARN: The ARN of the SSL/TLS certificate.

This modular approach allows for easy management and scalability of the infrastructure components. Each module is responsible for a specific part of the infrastructure, making it easier to maintain and update.

## Application

The application is built using FastAPI and provides endpoints to interact with an S3 bucket. Below is an overview of how the application works:

**Configuration:** The application uses environment variables to configure the S3 client. These variables are loaded from a .env file using dotenv. The required environment variables are:
```
S3_ENDPOINT: The endpoint URL for the S3 service.
S3_REGION: The AWS region where the S3 bucket is located (default: us-east-1).
S3_ACCESS_KEY: The access key for the S3 service.
S3_SECRET_KEY: The secret key for the S3 service.
S3_BUCKET_NAME: The name of the S3 bucket.
```

**S3 Client:** The application uses the boto3 library to interact with the S3 service. The S3Client class is a singleton that ensures only one S3 client instance is created. The client is configured using the environment variables.

**Endpoints:** The application provides the following endpoints:
```
GET /: Lists all available endpoints in the application.
GET /health: Returns the health status of the application.
GET /list-bucket-content: Lists the contents of the S3 bucket at the root level.
GET /list-bucket-content/{path:path}: Lists the contents of the S3 bucket at the specified path.
```

**Error & Edge Cases Handling:** The application handles errors related to S3 client operations. If a PermanentRedirect error occurs, the client is reconfigured to use the correct region. If an EndpointConnectionError occurs, a 500 HTTP error is returned. If the response from the S3 service is paginated, the application fetches all pages to return the complete list of objects.

Running the Application
To run the application, use the following command:
```bash
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
This will start the FastAPI application on http://0.0.0.0:8000.

Example Usage
To list all available endpoints:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/
```
Example Response:
```
{
  "endpoints": [
    "/",
    "/health",
    "/list-bucket-content/{path}",
    "/list-bucket-content"
  ]
}
```
---
To check the health status:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```
Example Response:
```
{
  "status": "healthy"
}
```
---
To list the contents of the S3 bucket at the root level:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/list-bucket-content
```
Example Response:
```
{
  "content": [
    "ANNOUNCEMENTS",
    "CompanyUpdates",
    "MMI_2019-10-1.csv",
    "MMI_2019-10-10.csv",
    "MMI_2019-10-11.csv"
  ]
}
```
---
To list the contents of the S3 bucket at a specific path:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/list-bucket-content/some/path
```
Example Response:
```
# If the path does not exist

{
  "error": "Path 'demo' does not exist in the bucket"
}

-- OR --

# If the path exists

{
  "content": [
    "3PLA",
    "63MO",
    "8KMS",
    "A2ZI",
    "AAA"
  ]
}
```
---
To run the test suite:
```bash
pytest test_app.py
```

## Future Improvements

- Add a CI/CD pipeline to deploy the application and infrastructure. (Jenkins/ArgoWorkflow + CodeDeploy)
- Add a monitoring and logging system to monitor the application and infrastructure.
- Add a backup and recovery system to backup the application and infrastructure.
- Add a caching mechanism to improve the performance of the application.
- Add AWS WAF to the ALB to improve the security of the application.
